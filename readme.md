## A place to learn about money, budgets, and finances.

We are a small team that is building a unique experience to help children understand how money works.

We are solving the problem of the lack of financial education in a world or during time where we have access to buy so much with so little knowledge of how that will affect us. Kids want it all without the knowledge of the means to get it or the cost. Teaching the cause/ effect theory of money.

Are you interested in joining us on our journey to help our next generations understand the cost of having it all and what it takes to get there?
